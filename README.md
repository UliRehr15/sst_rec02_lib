# sst_rec02_lib

sstRec02Lib - Library for working with records

This lib based on idea "STASH" from bruce eckels book "thinking in c++".

I take this idea as base for small record management system.

This library should be build with QT 5 and qt creator 3.0.

Structure of coding projects should be:

.. [libs]
   [sstRec02Lib]
